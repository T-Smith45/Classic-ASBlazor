# 🚀 Minimal API Interactivity Template: Your Choice, Your UI!

---

Tired of boilerplate? Ready to build blazing-fast APIs with the UI framework that fits your mood? Say hello to the **Minimal API Interactivity Template**! 🎉

This template is your one-stop shop for whipping up a .NET 9 Minimal API backend, giving you the awesome power to choose between two fantastic frontend interactivity styles: **Blazor** (for that C# all-the-way, server-rendered magic) or **HTMX** (for that hypermedia-driven, JavaScript-minimal goodness).

## ✨ Features That'll Make You Smile

* **⚡️ Lean & Mean Minimal API:** Get a super-fast, lightweight API foundation right out of the box.
* **👯‍♀️ Blazor or HTMX Interactivity:**
    * Choose **Blazor** for a rich, server-rendered, component-based UI experience using C# and `.razor` files, much like the classic ASP days but with modern tooling and efficiency. Minimal client-side JavaScript is required for interactivity.
    * Choose **HTMX** for dynamic, hypermedia-driven interfaces with minimal JavaScript.
* **🚦 Smart HTMX Middleware:** Our custom middleware intelligently blocks non-HTMX requests to dedicated HTMX endpoints in production, keeping your APIs secure and tidy. Don't worry, it stays out of your way in development for easier debugging!
* **🧩 Modular & Extensible:** A clean, well-structured starting point for your next great idea.
* **🚀 Ready to Run:** Spin up and start coding in seconds!

## 🤸‍♀️ Why Choose This Template?

* **Experimentation Station:** Easily try out Blazor and HTMX without starting from scratch.
* **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly stand up interactive web apps with a robust backend.
* **Familiar Feel for Server-Side Devs (Blazor):** If you loved the direct server-side interactivity of Classic ASP.NET, Blazor's server-rendered model will feel right at home, but with all the power of C#.
* **Production-Ready Baseline:** Get a solid foundation with security considerations baked in.
* **No More Copy-Pasting:** Forget the tedious setup; just `dotnet new` and go!
